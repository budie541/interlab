	<p> I took a coding class in high school that was mandatory and covered the basics of html and css, though I don't remember much of it. I relearned most of it last semester in Interaction 1 (used GitHub and Sublime). Honestly the most difficult part was trying to understand how everything worked, so I relied more heavily on searching things up and basing everything on what I found instead of actually understanding the content. I never really wanted to learn to code, but I figured it would be a helpful skill to have, and I never would have taught it to myself.

	I think HTML is the content itself and its basic formatting and CSS and JavaScript are the styling/how the content is presented (?)</p>

	<h1> Indonesian anything </h1>
	<h2> Hotpot </h2>
	<h3> Bread with a dip or something </h3>
	<h4> Fish (general) </h4>
	<h5> Root vegetables (general also) </h5>
